#  cvault — Centralized Claude Code Credential Vault
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This file is the canonical Homebrew formula for `cvault`. The `update-tap`
#  job in .github/workflows/release-cli.yml copies this template into the
#  homebrew tap repo (flatoutsolutions/homebrew-cvault) and substitutes:
#
#    * the `version "..."` line
#    * the `sha256 "..."` line below
#
#  Hand-edits to the placeholder markers will get clobbered by CI on the next
#  release. Edit structure, descriptions, caveats here; never edit hashes.
#
#  Distribution model (per docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-03-cvault-production-deployment.md):
#  Bun's `--compile` Mach-O output is unsignable on macOS (Bun 1.3.12 bug),
#  so cvault ships as a single bundled `cvault.bundle.js` plus a thin bash
#  shim that `exec`s it through homebrew's `bun`. One artifact for every
#  platform — no per-OS or per-arch matrix.

  # The bundle is plain JavaScript — Bun is the only runtime dependency.
  # Bun is NOT in homebrew-core; it ships exclusively through the official
  # `oven-sh/bun` tap (https://github.com/oven-sh/homebrew-bun). Declaring
  # the dep with its fully-qualified name lets `brew install cvault`
  # auto-tap `oven-sh/bun` for users who don't already have it, instead
  # of failing with "No available formula with the name 'bun'".

  def install
    # The release tarball contains a single file: cvault.bundle.js. Drop
    # it into libexec (Homebrew convention for non-PATH-exposed assets)
    # and synthesize a tiny bash wrapper at bin/cvault that calls bun on
    # it. The wrapper has the resolved absolute paths to bun + bundle
    # baked in at install time, so it works correctly regardless of the
    # user's PATH ordering or shell.

      First-time setup:

          cvault login        # browser-assisted Clerk sign-in
          cvault add          # capture the currently-active Claude Code login
          cvault list         # verify it landed in the vault

      `cvault add` requires the `claude` CLI on PATH (Claude Code itself).
    EOS
  end

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Sanity check — `brew test cvault` invokes this. Keep it cheap (no network,
  # no Convex round-trip). Both flags must work on a fresh install with no
  # `~/.vault/` config present.
  #
  # `--version` prints only the bare version string (e.g. "0.1.0"), so we
  # compare against a semver-ish regex rather than asserting the binary name
  # appears. `--help` is the dependable place to grep for "cvault".
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    assert_match(/^\d+\.\d+\.\d+/, shell_output("#{bin}/cvault --version"))
    assert_match "cvault", shell_output("#{bin}/cvault --help")
